# WRITTEN BUT NEVER RUN BY AN AGENT. The human runs it. Three gates apply:
#   1. The contract repo has a built wasm (this script builds it if not).
#   2. A real school or tutorial centre has agreed to try the flow. Set
#      PILOT_CONFIRMED=yes only when that is actually true.
#   3. The signing identity is read from STELLAR_ACCOUNT. This script never
#      reads, prints or stores a secret key itself.
#
# Usage (from the schoolfees-app repo, with the contracts repo beside it):
#   PILOT_CONFIRMED=yes STELLAR_ACCOUNT=dev ./scripts/deploy-testnet.sh

refusing to deploy: the pilot gate is not cleared.

No schoolfees contract is deployed until a real school or tutorial centre has
agreed to try the flow. When that has actually happened, re-run with:

  PILOT_CONFIRMED=yes STELLAR_ACCOUNT=<identity> ./scripts/deploy-testnet.sh

  contract id: $CONTRACT_ID

Next steps, all manual:
  1. Put it in this repo's .env as:  VITE_CONTRACT_ID=$CONTRACT_ID
     (.env is git-ignored; never commit it.)
  2. Record the id and the explorer link in the docs repo — real values only.
  3. Tell the pilot participant the contract id and a fee id, out of band.
